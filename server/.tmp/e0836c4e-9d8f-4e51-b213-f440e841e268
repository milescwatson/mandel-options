<DIV>
<B>I am Mr. Ibrahim Mustafa Magu the chairman of ECONOMIC &amp; FINANCIAL CRIME COMMISSION (EFCC), EFCC in alliance with economic community of West African states (ECOWAS) with head Office here in Nigeria, We have been working towards the eradication of fraudsters and scam Artists in Western part of Africa With the help of United States Government and the United Nations.</B></DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
<B> </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>The Anti-corruption war has taken a turn as the past chairman of this commission Mr. Ibrahim Lamorde a police officer, was removed as EFCC chairman on November 9, 2015 four years after he took over as head of the anti-graft agency and is under investigation for alleged diversion of N1 trillion and charged to court on the 17th November 2015 in a supreme court in Abuja, you can also follow the link for more informations.</B></DIV>

<DIV>
<B> </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>The EFCC as an agency that is founded on transparency is not afraid of any “probe” or request for information regarding its activities by individuals, groups or organs of government; so far as such requests followed due process of law. The EFCC under Lamorde did not need the prompting of anyone, when it commissioned a reputable international audit firm, KPMG to carry out comprehensive audit of exhibits and forfeited assets of the Commission from 2003 to date.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B> </B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>

<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>We have been able to recover so much money from this hoodlums, corrupt government officials and these scam artists, the New minister of Finance Federal Republic of Nigeria Mrs. Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed under president Muhammadu Buhari, and the CBN issued a statement on February 20th 2016 to the effect that the CBN is against the fleecing of customers under any guise and with the mandate of the Apex Bank, issued a deposit refund of N6.2 Billion excess charges on cost of transaction for 2015 alone. This refund, the CBN said arose from more 6,000 complaints of unauthorised bank charges brought to its notice. So the United Nations Anti-crime commission, the United States Government and the CBN have ordered the money recovered from the Scammers/Government officials to be shared among 100 Lucky people around the globe.</B></DIV>
