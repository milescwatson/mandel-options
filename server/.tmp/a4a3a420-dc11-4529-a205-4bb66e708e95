MR. DAVID ELLIS, HEAD OF INSPECTION UNIT UNITED NATIONS INSPECTION AGENCY H=
ARTS FIELD-JACKSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. ATLANTA , GEORGIA I am David Elli=
s Head of Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Harts field-J=
ackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia.During our investigation, I d=
iscovered An abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom whic=
h was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport To our facility here in Atlanta, =
and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk B=
oxes weighing approximately 110kg each. The consignment was abandoned becau=
se the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather i=
t was declared as personal Effect/classified document to either avoid diver=
sion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The=
 diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are=
 the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment,=
 each of the boxes contains about $4M or more.They are still left in the ai=
rport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two met=
al trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x =
D73 (cm) effective Capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consi=
gnment including your name and email on the official document from United N=
ations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/=
classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have =
to reconfirm your Full name, Phone Number, full address so I can cross-chec=
k and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is n=
ow left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repa=
triate it back to UK (place of origin) as we were instructed. Like I did sa=
y again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he =
gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not=
 secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you i=
n any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also gi=
ve me something out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in=
 person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/a=
gent that will provide the necessary security That is required to deliver t=
he package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all t=
he guarantee that I can get from you before I can get involved in this proj=
ect. Email (ellisdavid585@gmail.com) Best Regards, David Ellis INSPECTION O=
