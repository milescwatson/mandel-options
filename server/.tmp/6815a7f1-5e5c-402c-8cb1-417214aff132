ATTENTION BENEFICIARY 

REF: - INSTRUCTION TO CREDIT YOUR ACCOUNT WITH THE SUM OF (US$15M)

Dear Valued Customer? We are aware that this is certainly not a conventional way of approaching an unknown person for establishment of project and investment but after due vetting and evaluation of your Inheritance file which the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in conjunction with the Ministry Of Finance Of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Forwarded and contacted us to see to your immediate payment of the sum of US$15,000,000.00 from their Offshore Account with us.

We were meant to understand from our findings that you have been going through hard ways by paying a lot of charges to see to the release of your fund (US$15,000,000.00), which has been delayed. Which has been the handiwork of some miscreant elements from Nigeria, so, we advice you to stop further communication with any correspondence from Nigeria as you have met up with Barclays Bank directly, although’ we knew that your representatives in Nigeria will tell you to still go ahead with him/her  but on your own risk.

The only thing required from you is to obtain Non-Resident Clearance Form/Receipt which we are not asking you to pay the fee to us here in United Kingdom as the Government of Nigeria have paid us for handling/processing of your payment with other customers. We will help you to see that you obtain the Non-Residential Clearance form so that our bank will affect immediate transfer of your Inheritance fund sum of (US$15,000,000.00) into your designated bank account. If you follow up our directives Hon.Emmanuel Justice (San) instructions, your fund will reflect into your bank account within five Bank working days from the day you obtain your Non-Residential Clearance form and below is Hon.Emmanuel Justice (San) contact information.
