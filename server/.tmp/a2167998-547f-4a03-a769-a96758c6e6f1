Dear Friend

I am so much worried all these while that you have not received your
fund after several attempt and effort with some resources being voted
in.However,I have not given up effort for the actualization of your
payment but my hands was tied up because of the constant problems
along the line.the format Today there is a good news about your
payment,there is a seminar that took place last week here in Abuja the
 capital of Nigeria  which involves some expatriate and it happens
that I met one time course make when I was undergoing my masters
degree who came from Britain,it happens that we lost contact for years
but as God may do it she was among the entourage who came from
Britain.

I had the opportunity of explaining to her the condition of your fund
starting from day one because she is a notable lawyer in Britain and
works with Financial Conduct Authority in UK and their solicitor,the
lady told me that it will be difficult for you to receive the fund
from Africa direct to your account/country because of high corruption
and undeveloped financial practice in Africa, she advised me that the
best way you can be paid is that she will send an application to
(AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS NIGERIA) on behalf of Financial
Conduct Authority London and the fund will be directed to UK under the
authority of FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY BACKED UP WITH UNITED
NATIONS as an entity. She said that this arrangement will not cost you
money for your fund to be in UK with F.C.A and F.C.A  will immediately
move the fund to you she said that no organization can ever interfere
hence the Financial Conduct Authority is involved, so

I have forwarded all your information to the lawyer in London and she
have been in contact with (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS  NIGERIA)
the god news now is that the lawyer contacted me yesterday confirming
to me that your fund is with Financial Conduct Authority in
London,but she said that she will contact you first before F.C.A .

Her information is:
Name: Barrister Adrienne Page.
Email:adriennepageassociates22222@mail.ru
Phone: +447452240165

Please wait for her email and let me know as soon as you hear from her
by forwarding her message to me,I can give you 100% assurance that you
will receive your fund this time so kindly work with her.You can
equally send her message regarding to this update as you know that
such lawyer may be so busy.

Regards
Mrs Ann Ugoh
