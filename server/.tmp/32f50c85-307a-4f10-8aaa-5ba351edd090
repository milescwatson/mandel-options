Dear Friend,

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this email, if the content do=
es not meet with your personal and business ethics; I wish to apologize in =
advance. I am Barrister Phillip Adams, Esq. I have a client who bears the s=
ame last name with you and a nationality of your country, who was a Gold tr=
ader here in Republic of Benin. On the 30th October 2014, my client was inv=
olved in a car accident and unfortunately lost his life in the event of the=
 crash. Since then I have tried to locate any of his relative but to no ava=
il and the bank here where he had a fixed deposit of US$7.5 Million in his =
account has now issued me a notice to provide his next of kin within the ne=
xt 2 months or they will confiscate the funds since there is no registered =
next of kin on the bank form he filled at the time he deposited the funds.

So, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my late client=
 so that the funds will be transferred to you as the beneficiary, then you =
and I will share the funds, instead of the bank to confiscate the funds. Af=
ter a successful transfer of funds to your bank account as planned, we will=
 share the funds accordingly 50% for me and 50% to you. Fortunately, whethe=
r you are a direct relative of him or not is never a barrier to the success=
 of the claim procedure. Kindly get back to me, if you are willing to work =
with me on this transaction and send me your information: YOUR FULL NAME, A=
DDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER for the processing of the legal documents that will=
 be used to backup this funds claim in your name as the next of kin/benefic=
iary of the funds.
