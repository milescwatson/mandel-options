Attention,
 =

I am Bruce George, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspectio=
n Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International=
 Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abando=
ned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred f=
rom JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it=
 revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing appro=
ximately 130kg.

The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared=
 by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classi=
fied document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscati=
on by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Ins=
pection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delay=
ed and abandoned.
 =

By my assessment, each of the boxes contains $4M  which is total of $8Milli=
on USD. They are  still left in the airport storage facility till today. Th=
e Consignments like I said are two  metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg e=
ach (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) =
Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email=
 on the official document from United Nations' office in London where the s=
hipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still availab=
le with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone N=
umber, full address so I  can cross-check and see if it corresponds with th=
e one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you sti=
ll need the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK
(place of origin) as we were instructed.
 =

As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly =
because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, h=
e could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to a=
ssist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you w=
ill also give me something  out of it (financial gratification). You can ei=
ther come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delive=
ry Company/agent that will provide the  necessary security that is required=
 to deliver the package to your doorstep or the  destination of your choice=
. I need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get involv=
ed in this project.


Best Regards,

Mr.Bruce George
Head Officer-in-Charge
Administrative Service Inspection Unit.
