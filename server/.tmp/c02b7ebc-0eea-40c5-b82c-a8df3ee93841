Hello Beloved,

I am Carol Mitchell a Missionary formally with Saints Peter and Paul
Church Catholic North Beach/Telegraph Hill 666 Filbert St San
Francisco, CA 94133 USA, I have the Sum of US$6M in Citibank Bank
N.A(New York) before I was diagnosed with cancer of the blood and
according to my doctors I have just two or three weeks to live.

So I want you to help me stand as my Next of Kin to enable Citibank
Bank Transfer this US$6M to you, note that you will take US$3M out of
this US$6M and give the remaining US$3M to any Charity Home here in
United State, Africa, Canada, Europe and Asia because that was the vow
I made to my God Almighty before I became a Missionary.

I want you to get back to me immediately if you are interested to
stand as my Next of Kin, So that I can introduce you to my Lawyer,Bank
and direct you on how to proceed before I pass away in this world
because I have only two weeks to live according to my Doctor. I wait
your urgent response.


Thanks,
Missionary Carol Mitchell.
Saints Peter and Paul Church
