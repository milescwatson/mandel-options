Hello Beneficiary:

I am most delighted and honored to bring to your knowledge through this med=
ium the resolution of  2020 Submit over pending beneficiary payment. =

After a closed door meeting with Mike Pompeo U.S Secretary of State, we dis=
covered that the reason while all your painstaking efforts to claim your fu=
nds were fruitless is because some dubious payment officials are trying to =
divert your fund.

With this knowledge, you are mandated to disregard any person or person(s) =
contacting you regarding your payment, this is because your payment files a=
nd all documents that are connected with the approval of your funds have be=
en repurchased by this office. By virtue of this arrangement exclusively de=
signed in your favor, we oblige you to STOP every form of communication wit=
h those impostors.

Be informed that base on these facts the Human right Organization presented=
 your file to this office. We express dissatisfaction over the unprofession=
al approach towards the release of your payment. As part of lost of confide=
nce in the past payment administration, they retrieved your files/appraisal=
 documents and forwarded copies to our office for proper administrative pro=
cess.

Having conducted proper scrutiny and authentication in pursuance to your cl=
aim, you are further advice to re-confirm your details, to enable us expedi=
te action towards processing the release of your payment as purported. Also=
 noted that unnecessary administrative protocols plotted by dubious/imposto=
rs to perpetually frustrate you
from receiving your funds has been noted, nullified and shattered.

Sincerely,
Mrs.Margaret Banks
