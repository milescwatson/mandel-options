FROM Miss Mary Dakota.
28 B32EW colmore tottenham court,london

I am a deaf girl the only daughter of my late parents Mr. and Mrs. Dakota
My father was a highly reputable business man (A COCOA DEALER) who
operated in the Economic capital of (West African Island) during his days.
I am a deaf girl.


It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of
his business trips abroad year 12th.February 2019. Though his sudden death
was linked or

rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who traveled
with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was
just 14years old
and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on February
12, 2019 he called the secretary who accompanied him to hospital and told
him that he has the

sum of US$380,500,000:00(THREE HUNDRED AND  EIGHTY MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) left in a security company. He further
told him that he deposited the money with my name.

I am a deaf girl just 30 years old and university undergraduate and really
don't know what to do, Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer
this funds and

after the transaction I will come over and by your help I could settle
down and plan my future. This is because I have suffered a lot of set
backs as a result of
incessant political crisis here in London. The death of my father actually
brought sorrow to my life.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards, I wish
to invest under your care please. Your suggestions
 =

and ideas will be highly regarded But permit me to ask these few questions:

1. Can you honestly help me as you would do to your own relation?
2. Can I completely trust you as a reliable person? .
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you
after the money has been transferred into your account?
