Dear Sir,

I am Tom Benson, 16 yrs old orphan from South Sudan. My entire family were killed in the present crisis that is still going on in my country South Sudan. I am presently in a refugee camp in a neighboring country here in Africa, to save my own life. I need your help to receive the funds of my late father and help me relocate to your country. My late father deposited sum money totaling Five Million US Dollars (US$5,000,000.00) at a bank here. Because of my age and limited status, I want you to help me stand before the bank as my guardian overseas so that the bank can transfer the money to your safe bank account as the document of deposit of the funds has stated I can only have access to the funds when I am 30 years old or provide a guardian to receive and invest the funds on my behalf. I shall give you further details on hearing from you so please help me fast. Waiting for your reply and info to my email.

Sincerely,
Tom Benson
