through Next Rated Courier Delivery Company to enable you commence the char=
ity Project as I wishes hence my health is not really promising me.

ou are advice to reconfirm your full delivery information to the Agent righ=
t now as he is currently at Orlando Florida International Airport USA with =
the package, He called Rev. Kenneth Callaway this morning to inform him tha=
t he misplaced your delivery address which he had due to CUSTOMS/CIA and HO=
MELAND SECURITIES because of this CORVID19 Pandemic searching, scanning and=
 testing on him with the Box as if he had committed a huge crime but finall=
y they confirmed that his movement is clear and genue without any suspiciou=
s intentions.

So you are advice to reconfirm your full delivery information to the diplom=
at and call him on +1 305-998-7835 so as to have easy conversation with him=
 and to enable you give him full direction to get the package delivered, Fu=
rthermore you are advice to be very fast as the Delivery Agent has no time =
