Attn: Sir/Madam

A customer of ours who died nine years ago in Tsunami tragedy in Indonesia =
leaving behind an estate/capital (US$20M) in a Bank here where I work, till=
 date nobody has come forward or put application for the claim.

and email contact was among the findings that matches the same surname as t=

after a statutory time period when dormant accounts of this type are called=
 in by the monetary regulatory bodies if nobody applies to claim the funds.=

for you to claim the estate/capital so that I can be gratify by you,in this=
 way $12,000,000.00 for you and $8,000,000.00 for me. I will do all the cru=
cial part in the Bank to have the claim released to you promptly.

 issue to affirm your willingness and cooperation, please do so by replying=
 via my email address:( jamesmorgan0099@onet.pl ) and include your Full Nam=
e, Contact Address, Occupation, Sex, Date Of Birth and Telephone/Fax number=
