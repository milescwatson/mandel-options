Dear Sir/Madam,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I am Barrister Sandra Otti, I work with Ministry Of Foreign Affairs &amp; Regional Integration here in Cotonou, Republic Of Benin, A delivery Agent by name Mr.John Williams came down last week from your country with a package that contained Atm Visa Card Lottery Compensation Funds worth of $5.5 Million Dollars, He submitted the package to our office on his arrival for safe keeping and later his body was found dead in a ghastly auto crash in the city. We have sent the package back to your country USA via diplomatic services because there is no other way to locate you in respect of the package.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
The only information we have about you is your email address/name which he wrote somewhere in the document attached to the package. So we are emailing you in respect of this to know if you are the rightful owner of the Atm Visa Card so that you can contact the assigned diplomatic who arrived your country with your package a while ago. Please if you are the owner,kindly contact the diplomatic Agent Mr. David Mark by email: ( agent.davidmark015@gmail.com ) and reconfirm your full information such as your full name your home address, your contact phone number and nearest airport include your Id to enable him deliver the package to you safely; I anticipate your update once you get in contact with the diplomat.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Best Regards.</DIV>
<DIV>
Barr. Sandra Otti.</DIV>
