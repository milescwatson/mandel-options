(Office of the Under Secretary)

Washington D.C. 20220.

Attention: Beneficiary,

I am Mr.Steven Mnuchin , the formal partner of Goldman Sachs and hedge fund=
 manager. I'm the newly appointed United States Secretary of the Treasury  =
Department and was sworn in as the 77th Secretary of the United States Depa=
rtment of the Treasury of the administration of President Donald Trump, and=
 Vice President Mike Pence.

Following series of complaints from Citizens of the United States as well a=
s Citizens of Other Countries In Europe over the Discrepancies and fraudule=
nt ways in which fund transfers are handled by Africans which has made it i=
mpossible for a lot of People to claim their Winning prize or Inheritance f=
unds from most African Countries due to frauds and illegal activities, A de=
cision was reached recently by the United States Treasury Department under =
the authority of the White House to compel African Financial bodies (Banks)=
 to urgently release all funds of Asian, American and European citizens and=
 other geographic continents  that are trapped in most Banks and Courier Co=
mpanies in Africa. It was discovered that some bureaucratic bottlenecks wer=
e put by these Banks and Couriers to make it impossible for beneficiaries t=
o claim their funds so that they will fraudulently divert those funds to th=
eir private accounts.

Consequent upon the aforementioned, I was personally mandated to handle thi=
s matter to ensure that all funds of our Citizens and others countries whic=
h are fraudulently being trapped in African Banks are urgently retrieved an=
d paid to the actual Beneficiaries under a legal manner. Our team of expert=
s were delegated to Benin Republic, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana for this=
 task and we discovered your File NO: BR227/9005666/00 as unclaimed fund.It=
 was discovered that officials of the
Bank has only put up illegal requirements in order to make it difficult for=
 you to claim your fund.

The United States Department of Treasury has retrieved all Files of illegal=
 transactions and all have been arrested for this act . However, we will be=
 working under a legitimate arrangement to ensure that you follow the norma=
l process to receive your fund.You are requested to Re-confirm the followin=
g information to Dir Collins Nelson.
